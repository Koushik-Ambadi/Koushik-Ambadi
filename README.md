## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Terra Data ➜ BigQuery Migration (Verizon)
- Migrated enterprise data from **Teradata** (row-based) to **BigQuery** (columnar).
- Designed schema mappings (`INTEGER → INT64`, constraints, and PKs).
- Automated ETL with **DataFlow** for batch transformation & ingestion from **GCS**.
- Implemented **validation & fallback orchestration** using **LangChain** with:
  - **SQLCoder** for intelligent query understanding & optimization.
  - **SQLGlot** for deterministic SQL dialect conversion across 50+ dialects.

### 🔹 Predictive Network Maintenance (Verizon)
- Built a **classification model** (High/Mid/Low service impact) on 5M+ records.
- Performed feature engineering: datetime normalization, duration extraction, outlier removal, and imputation.
- Tackled **class imbalance** using **SMOTE** and improved minority class F1 score.
- Integrated **TF-IDF + PCA** for textual features from incident descriptions.
- Used **GridSearchCV** and **RandomSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluated using **precision, recall, F1-score**, and bias–variance trade-off analysis.

### 🔹 LLM Fine-Tuning for Test Case Generation (Navtech)
- Fine-tuned **Mistral-7B** locally using **LoRA** and **QLoRA** with **PEFT** for efficient training.
- Mapped requirement–test case traceability and handled pre/post conditions.
- Preprocessed data, managed missing values, and optimized memory with **8-bit quantization**.
- Enhanced test case generation accuracy and domain-specific understanding.

### 🔹 Variable Name Generator Tool (Navtech)
- Developed a scalable tool using **FastAPI** with a simple **HTML/CSS UI**.
- Integrated **LLM APIs** to generate standardized variable names and acronyms.
- Enabled **custom naming conventions**, **admin approval**, and **modular extensibility** for future features.
